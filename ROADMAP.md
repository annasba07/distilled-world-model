## 💭 Final Thoughts

This project represents a critical step in democratizing AI world models. By making this technology accessible to individual developers and small teams, we're enabling a new wave of creative applications that were previously impossible.

**Remember:** We're not trying to beat Genie 3 on quality - we're trying to beat it on accessibility. If a teenager with a gaming laptop can generate interactive worlds, we've won.
